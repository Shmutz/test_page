	The reason I have to do it this way is because I&rsquo;ve grown tired of the restrictions of fiat payment providers.
	I advise ya to read up on btc when getting started so ya know what ya doing but as volatile as it all is atm,
	it&rsquo;s also very promising.<br />I&rsquo;m taking my chances and I wish you the best luck as well.
	<br/>
	Don&rsquo;t feel obligated to do anything but if ya do, thank you!
